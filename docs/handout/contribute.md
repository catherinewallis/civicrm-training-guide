- Select the dummy payment processor

2) Once you have created your contribution page, test that it is working as expected by making a donation using the contribution page.

3) Use the checklist below to make sure the donation process happened as expected.

1) Add a premium to your contribution page so that people that donate at least 50 get a cool T-shirt

2) Make sure that the donor can spread the word about your fundraising campaign via social media

3) Create a new contribution type called 'Annual fundraising drive' and make sure that all contributions collected via this page contribute to are classed as this contribution type.

4) Remove the confirmation page to increase the conversion rate for your donations

5) Add a 'Donate' link to your contribution page in the primary links menu on your site.

6) Create a custom field for a profile that allows donors to choose one of three different ways for you to spend their contribution and add this question to your contribution page via a profile.

7) Create a widget that shows how well you are doing towards meeting this pages fundraising goals and put in on your site's home page.

8) Improve the thank you and receipting with a message that, for example encourages the donor to take another action
