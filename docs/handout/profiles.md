# Profiles

## Introduction

By the end of this session, you should understand how to add a new Profile and edit existing Profiles

## **More information**

You can find more information and background on the topics covered in this session in the CiviCRM user and administrator book profile section.

## **Exercises**

You will be asked to setup and edit a new profile. You can either use the details below or make up your own examples.

1. Create a profile that a visitor to your website can fill in to tell you about themselves and name the fields (Field Labels) in a way that your site users will understand. If you created custom data for an individual in the Organising Data exercise, consider also using those fields in your profile

- First name
- Last name
- Email address
- Home phone number
- Current employer
- Others that you would find useful

2. Make sure that anyone filling in the new profile is added to a 'Potential Volunteers Group'

3. To avoid spam submissions, set up a reCaptcha for the profile. Verify that your reCaptcha key is present and working. (you'll need to apply for one if you do not have one).

4. What is the live URL for your new profile?

5. Check the database to see if the data you added is there as expected.

## More exercises

If you have time try...

1. Exploring the Reserved Profiles and see which elements can be edited

2. Creating a profile for new user registrations on your Drupal site so that you can capture their phone number when they register as site users

3. Creating an email with a checksum token link that authenticates recipients and allows them to update their contact details.
