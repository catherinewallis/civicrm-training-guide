# CiviCRM for Fundraisers in 1 day

## Trainer Notes

### Objectives:

* Understand how the CiviCRM community works and where you can find further information and support
* Know how to use CiviCRM as a day to day user
* Be able to plan and configure CiviCRM installations
* Understand the different CiviCRM Modules which fundraising organisations are likely to use

### Is previous knowledge assumed?

* That the learners are familiar with using online software applications / Office based software

### Materials and equipment required:
* Each learner should be given; a copy of the Course Timetable, details of each session with the exercises, details on how they access support and access online resources.
* A projector and computer for the trainer to demonstrate the session materials
* Each learner (or pair of learners) will have access to a computer which can connect to a CiviCRM installation. These computers are used by the learner to complete the session exercises

### Delivery Notes:
- The programme below lists a suggested timetable and session order.
- Trainer notes for each session can be found on the CiviCRM Wiki page http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRM/Sessions
- All of the sessions are run without user exercises and apart from Introducing CiviCRM are run as as half hour sessions only
- We have only included the sessions which we think would be of the most use to fundraising organisations but there should be an overview of all components in the introductory session.
